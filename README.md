#   Application Guideline

Application could be start with .exe(MarsRoverControl/MarsRoverControl/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/MarsRoverControl.exe)

This application has been developed for the control mechanisms of Rover vehicles traveling on the Mars surface.

When the application starts, it prompts the user to enter the surface size. (You must enter the width and height with a space between them. For example :5 3)

And then, application creates the surface.

First rover will be positioned on the surface. You must enter the coordinates and direction you want to position (valid directions : N, E, S, W), with a space between them. (For example :1 3 W)

The application will prompt you for a command to move the first vehicle. (You must enter commands without any spaces between them. You can use these commands:L,R,M. For example:MLRLRMLR)

**Enjoy! Have a good time.**
